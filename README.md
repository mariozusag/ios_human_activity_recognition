This module contains code for analysing different datasets of iPhone sensor data 
(especially accelerator sensors). 


 Each network is given a unique specifier. For each successful run, a folder with the 
      network's specifier and the current datetime will be created with train and test results + the set of 
      used hyperparameters as well as training and testing deep learning models on
predicting whether
